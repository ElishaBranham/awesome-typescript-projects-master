### [oni](https://github.com/onivim/oni) - Modern Modal Editing - powered by Neovim

The goal of this project is to provide both the full-fledged Vim experience, with no compromises, while pushing forward to enable new scenarios.

Modern UX - The Vim experience should not be compromised with poor user experiences that stem from terminal limitations.
Rich plugin development - using JavaScript, instead of VimL, allowing deep-language integration.
Cross-platform support - across Windows, OS X, and Linux.
Batteries included - rich features are available out of the box - minimal setup needed to be productive. TypeScript development is the canonical example, but the hope is that other language providers will be included. Later, an included package manager will make it simple to find and install plugins.
Performance - no compromises, Vim is fast, and Oni should be fast too.
Ease Learning Curve - without sacrificing the Vim experience
Vim is an incredible tool for manipulating text at the speed of thought. With a composable, modal command language, it is no wonder that Vim usage is still prevalent today even in the realm of modern editors.

However, going from thought to code has some different challenges than going from thought to text. IDEs today provide several benefits that help to reduce cognitive load when writing code, and that benefit is tremendously important - not only in terms of pure coding efficiency and productivity, but also in making the process of writing code enjoyable and fun.

The goal of this project is to give an editor that gives the best of both worlds - the power, speed, and flexibility of using Vim for manipulating text, as well as the rich tooling that comes with an IDE.

### [cyclejs](https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs) - A functional and reactive JavaScript framework for predictable code

Cycle’s core abstraction is your application as a pure function main() where inputs are read effects (sources) from the external world and outputs (sinks) are write effects to affect the external world. These I/O effects in the external world are managed by drivers: plugins that handle DOM effects, HTTP effects, etc.

```ts
function main(sources) {
  const decrement$ = sources.DOM
    .select('.decrement').events('click').mapTo(-1);

  const increment$ = sources.DOM
    .select('.increment').events('click').mapTo(+1);

  const action$ = xs.merge(decrement$, increment$);
  const count$ = action$.fold((x, y) => x + y, 0);

  const vtree$ = count$.map(count =>
    div([
      button('.decrement', 'Decrement'),
      button('.increment', 'Increment'),
      p('Counter: ' + count)
    ])

## Library

### [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) - The de-facto solution to flexible routing with nested views in AngularJS

UI-Router applications are modeled as a hierarchical tree of states. UI-Router provides a state machine to manage the transitions between those application states in a transaction-like manner.

![](images/ui-router.png)


### [mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) - Simple, scalable state management.

MobX is a battle tested library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP).
The philosophy behind MobX is very simple:

_Anything that can be derived from the application state, should be derived. Automatically._

which includes the UI, data serialization, server communication, etc.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobxjs/mobx/master/docs/flow.png)

React and MobX together are a powerful combination. React renders the application state by providing mechanisms to translate it into a tree of renderable components. MobX provides the mechanism to store and update the application state that React then uses.

Both React and MobX provide very optimal and unique solutions to common problems in application development. React provides mechanisms to optimally render UI by using a virtual DOM that reduces the number of costly DOM mutations. MobX provides mechanisms to optimally synchronize application state with your React components by using a reactive virtual dependency state graph that is only updated when strictly needed and is never stale.


### [stryker](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker) - The extendable JavaScript mutation testing framework.

Professor X: For someone who hates mutants... you certainly keep some strange company.
William Stryker: Oh, they serve their purpose... as long as they can be controlled.

### [typeorm](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) - Data-Mapper ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript (ES7, ES6, ES5). Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQLite, MS SQL Server, Oracle, WebSQL databases. Works in Node.js and Browser.

TypeORM is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for node.js written in TypeScript that can be used with TypeScript or JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7). Its goal to always support latest JavaScript features and provide features that help you to develop any kind of applications that use database - from small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications.

```ts
import {Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, OneToOne, JoinColumn} from "typeorm";
import {Photo} from "./Photo";

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {

    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number;

    @Column("int")

Apollo Client is a fully-featured caching GraphQL client with integrations for React, Angular, and more. It allows you to easily build UI components that fetch data via GraphQL. To get the most value out of apollo-client, you should use it with one of its view layer integrations.


### [postgraphql](https://github.com/calebmer/postgraphql) - A GraphQL API created by reflection over a PostgreSQL schema.

With PostGraphQL, you can access the power of PostgreSQL through a well designed GraphQL server. PostGraphQL uses PostgreSQL reflection APIs to automatically detect primary keys, relationships, types, comments, and more providing a GraphQL server that is highly intelligent about your data.


### [InversifyJS](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS) - An isomorphic dependency injection library.

InversifyJS is an inversion of control library that works in both front-end and
back-end applications. InversifyJS is framework agnostic and can be integrated with
many existing frameworks like React applications powered by MobX or Node.js
applications powered by express.

InversifyJS is particularly well integrated with Express thanks to the
[inversify-express-utils](https://github.com/inversify/inversify-express-utils) project:

```ts
import * as express from "express";
import { Response, RequestParams, Controller, Get, Post, Put } from "inversify-express-utils";
import { injectable, inject } from "inversify";
import { interfaces } from "./interfaces";
import { Type } from "./types";

@injectable()
@Controller("/api/user")
class UserController {

    @inject(Type.UserRepository) private readonly _userRepository: interfaces.UserRepository,
    @inject(Type.Logger) private readonly _logger: interfaces.Logger

    @Get("/")
    public async get(
      @Request() req: express.Request,
      @Response() res: express.Response
    ) {
        try {
            this._logger.info(`HTTP ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
            return await this._userRepository.readAll();
        } catch (e) {
            this._logger.error(`HTTP ERROR ${req.method} ${req.url}`, e);
            res.status(500).json([]);
        }
    }

    @Get("/:email")
    public async getByEmail(
      @RequestParams("email") email: string,
      @Request() req: express.Request,
      @Response() res: express.Response
    ) {
        try {
            this._logger.info(`HTTP ${req.method} ${req.url}`);
            return await this._userRepository.readAll({ where: { email: email } });
        } catch (e) {
            this._logger.error(`HTTP ERROR ${req.method} ${req.url}`, e);
            res.status(500).json([]);
        }
    }

}
```

The [Inversify GitHub organization](https://github.com/inversify)
also provides the community with some helpers and examples to facilitate the integration of InversifyJS with other popular projects.


### [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript) - Create React apps using typescript with no build configuration.

### [ReactXP](https://github.com/microsoft/reactxp) - ReactXP is a library for cross-platform app development using React and React Native.

With React and React Native, your web app can share most its logic with your iOS and Android apps, but the view layer needs to be implemented separately for each platform. We have taken this a step further and developed a thin cross-platform layer we call ReactXP. If you write your app to this abstraction, you can share your view definitions, styles and animations across multiple target platforms. Of course, you can still provide platform-specific UI variants, but this can be done selectively where desired.


### [json-schema-to-typescript](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript) - Compile JSONSchema to TypeScript typings.


### [deeplearnjs](https://github.com/PAIR-code/deeplearnjs) - Hardware-accelerated deep learning and linear algebra (NumPy) library for the web.

deeplearn.js is an open source hardware-accelerated JavaScript library for machine intelligence. deeplearn.js brings performant machine learning building blocks to the web, allowing you to train neural networks in a browser or run pre-trained models in inference mode.

We provide two APIs, an immediate execution model (think NumPy) and a deferred execution model mirroring the TensorFlow API. deeplearn.js was originally developed by the Google Brain PAIR team to build powerful interactive machine learning tools for the browser, but it can be used for everything from education, to model understanding, to art projects.


### [intern](https://github.com/theintern/intern) - A next-generation code testing stack for JavaScript.

Intern is a complete test system for JavaScript designed to help you write and run consistent, high-quality test cases for your JavaScript libraries and applications. It can be used to test any JavaScript code.

Plain JavaScript code, in any module format (or no module format!)
Web pages generated by server-side languages (like Java, PHP, or Ruby)
Native or hybrid iOS, Android, and Firefox OS applications
Intern is minimally prescriptive and enforces only a basic set of best practices designed to ensure your tests stay maintainable over time. Its extensible architecture allows you to write custom test interfaces, executors, and reporters to influence how your tests run & easily integrate with your existing coding environment. Intern also comes with Grunt tasks so it can be quickly added to existing Grunt-based workflows, and is designed to work out-of-the-box with popular continuous integration services like Jenkins and Travis CI.


### [TypeDI](https://github.com/typestack/typedi) - Simple yet powerful dependency injection tool for TypeScript.

TypeDI is a dependency injection tool for TypeScript. Using TypeDI you can build well-structured and easily tested applications.


### [react-apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo) - React integration for Apollo Client.

TypeDI is a dependency injection tool for TypeScript. Using TypeDI you can build well-structured and easily tested applications.

React Apollo allows you to fetch data from your GraphQL server and use it in building complex and reactive UIs using the React framework. React Apollo may be used in any context that React may be used. In the browser, in React Native, or in Node.js when you want to do server-side rendering.

React Apollo unlike many other tools in the React ecosystem requires no complex build setup to get up and running. As long as you have a GraphQL server you can get started building out your application with React immediately. React Apollo works out of the box with both create-react-app and React Native with a single install and with no extra hassle configuring Babel or other JavaScript tools.

### [upterm](https://github.com/railsware/upterm) - Upterm (formerly Black Screen) is an IDE in the world of terminals. Strictly speaking, it's both a terminal emulator and an interactive shell based on Electron.

1. Autocompletion
Upterm shows the autocompletion box as you type and tries to be smart about what to suggest. Often you can find useful additional information on the right side of the autocompletion, e.g. expanded alias value, command descriptions, value of the previous directory (cd -), etc.

2. Compatibility
All command-line programs (including emacs, ssh and vim) should work as expected.

### [desktop](https://github.com/desktop/desktop) - Simple collaboration from your desktop.

### [rendertron](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron) - A Headless Chrome rendering solution.

Rendertron is designed to enable your Progressive Web App (PWA) to serve the correct content to any bot that doesn't render or execute JavaScript. Rendertron runs as a standalone HTTP server. Rendertron renders requested pages using Headless Chrome, auto-detecting when your PWA has completed loading and serializes the response back to the original request. To use Rendertron, your application configures middleware to determine whether to proxy a request to Rendertron. Rendertron is compatible with all client side technologies, including web components.
